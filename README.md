# Simple-Calculator
Calculator in C# This is my first C# project—a simple calculator using Windows Forms. It supports basic operations (+, -, ×, ÷), clear (C, CE), and delete (DEL) functions. The app ensures decimal point validation and displays the current operation. Built with C# and WinForms in Visual Studio.
